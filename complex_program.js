  Filename: complex_program.js

  This code is an elaborate and complex program designed to simulate a virtual ecosystem. 
  It includes various classes to represent different entities, such as animals, plants, and environments.
  Each entity has its own behaviors and interactions with others, creating a realistic ecosystem simulation.
